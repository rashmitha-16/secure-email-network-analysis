PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) - PGP is a commercial proprietary product
- Pretty Good Privacy uses several encryption technologies, like hashing, data compression, and public/private PGP keys to protect an organizationâ€™s critical information. 

OPENPGP:  PGP is the backbone of Open PGP, which is an open source standard that allows PGP to be used in software that is typically free to the public. 

GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) -  open-source and free
The GPG Project provides the tools and libraries to allows users to interface with a GUI or command line to integrate encryption with emails and operating systems like Linux. 

Both are encryption software tools that utilize the OpenPGP standard for secure communication and data encryption.They offer similar functionality.

#Sending Mails using PGP Encryption

PGP uses a combination of symmetric key encryption (i.e., a single-use session key encrypts and decrypts the message) and public key encryption (i.e., the keys 
unique to the recipient encrypt and decrypt the session key).

PGP combines the efficiency of symmetric encryption and the convenience of public key encryption. 

It is the most widely used encryption standard when it comes to end- to-end information encryption. It is used to verify whether the sent message is genuine or not.
